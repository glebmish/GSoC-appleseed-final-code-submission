# GSoC 2017 final report:
## AppleseedHQ: Python scripting feature
### Original proposal
[Python scripting feature for appleseed.studio](Proposal.md)
### Pre-GSoC work:
After first contact with appleseed I fixed some bugs and implemented a small project to get familiar with people, codebase and workflow in organization. Project was to implement packaging appleseed projects to zip-based containers

### GSoC work
Python scripting is a useful feature for applications like appleseed as it allows to automate repetetive actions, speed up development and expand functionality with user plugins.
To achive this goals I implemented following features:
* Python console inside appleseed.studio
* Python module that:
    1. gives access to project opened in appleseed.studio
    2. gives ability to customize appleseed.studio UI

During all development we with mentors discussed project daily. It had a huge influence on the process because they could guide me during implementation of every feature what made development process very productive. Also code was merged to master often giving ability all community to try new features, so I was receiving priceless feedback often and early. Thanks to many disucssions prior to GSoC and thoroughful planning of timeline all goals were met and new functionality is ready to use.
